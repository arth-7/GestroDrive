# Hand Gesture Controlled Robotic Car

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **gesture-controlled robotic car**, which can be navigated using hand gestures. It combines hardware (sensors, motors, controllers) and software (gesture recognition, embedded programming) to create an interactive robotic system.

## 📖 Overview
The robotic car responds to real-time hand gestures detected by sensors.  
Key features include:
- Gesture recognition for movement control (forward, backward, left, right, stop)  
- Hardware and software integration  
- Prototype demonstration and testing
